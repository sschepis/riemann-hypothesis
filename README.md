# A Constructive Spectral Framework for the Riemann Hypothesis via Symbolic Modular Potentials

**Author:** Sebastian Schepis

## Abstract

This project proposes a novel spectral framework potentially related to the Riemann Hypothesis. It involves constructing a finite-dimensional Hermitian operator whose eigenvalues numerically approximate the imaginary parts of the first few non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The operator acts on a Hilbert space spanned by prime-indexed basis states and incorporates symbolic potentials derived from a discrete Schr\"odinger equation over modular residue classes, designed to reflect prime density. Numerical results for \(N=50\) show close alignment with the initial zeta zeros (squared loss \(\mathcal{L} \approx 0.00073\)). While cross-validation and scaling tests suggest robustness, this work remains a proof-of-concept. Establishing a rigorous connection to the Riemann Hypothesis requires significant further theoretical development and validation of the underlying conjectures regarding the infinite-dimensional limit and spectral properties.

## How to Compile

To compile the paper into a PDF, you can use a standard LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live, MiKTeX) and run the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
pdflatex paper.tex
bibtex paper # If bibliography processing is needed
pdflatex paper.tex # Run again for references
pdflatex paper.tex # Run again for table of contents/cross-references
```

Alternatively, use a LaTeX editor with built-in compilation tools (e.g., TeXstudio, Overleaf).
